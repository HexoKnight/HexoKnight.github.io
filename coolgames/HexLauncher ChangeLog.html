        <h2>ChangeLog</h2>
        	  <br>
        	  - <strong>Everything</strong>: -<br>
          	- The ability to download, launch and even update all of the games I have made, -<br>
            - A method of running my old flash games that can no longer be run on coolgames, -<br>
            - A way to update the launcher itself (no need to ever come to this<br>website again :), but please do) -<br>
            <br>
            - A new organisation system, -<br>
            - 2 new games that were NOT made by me (Dragon Ball Z Devolution and Min Hero)<br>that you would be hard pressed to find in a working state<br>anywhere else, even on Flashpoint -<br>
            <br>
            - Dimensional Dungeon 3D!, -<br>
            - The entire changelog system finalmente, -<br>
            - Nicer scrollbars :) -<br>
  	  </div>
      <div class="main" style="width: 100%">
        <h2>To Do</h2>
          - Add more games if I ever make them -<br>
          <br>
          - Actually fix the changelog feature (it's a lot of effort;<br>i'd either have to think up an entire system to do it efficiently<br>or do a lot of stufff inefficiently) -<br>
