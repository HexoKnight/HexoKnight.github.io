        <h2>ChangeLog</h2>
        	  <br>
        	  - <strong>Everything</strong>: -<br>
          	- Movement, attacking, items (weapons, armour and other items), -<br>
            - inventory (with cool animation :) ), enemies, -<br>
            - random dungeon generation, -<br>
            - menus (with keybind changing :D, one of my favourite QoL features in games)  -<br>
            <br>
            - A more efficient font system (along with a new font), -<br>
            - Inventory labels to show what goes where, -<br>
            - A new enemy (fireball shooting mage) (and a projectile system to go along with it), -<br>
            - A stamina and mana system, -<br>
            - A bar for health and smaller ones for stamina and mana, -<br>
            - A permadeath system that completely resets the entire dungeon after you die, -<br>
            - A portal that spawns after the 'boss' is killed, that takes you to the next dungeon -<br>
  	  </div>
      <div class="main" style="width: 100%">
        <h2>To Do</h2>
          - Add more items -<br>
          <br>
          - Add more enemies -<br>
          <br>
          - Actually make further dungeons increase in difficulty -<br>
          <br>
          - Figure out how to make sprites in under an hour<br>(the fire crystal sprite literally took me a couple hours just because<br>I kept looking for the right colur/shape but couldn't get it right<br>and I just ended up going back to a previous design in the end) -<br>

    	    Update:<br>
        	  <br>
        	  Added:<br>
          	  Everything:<br>
          	  Movement, attacking, items (weapons, armour and other items),<br>
              inventory (with cool animation :) ), enemies,<br>
              random dungeon generation,<br>
              menus (with keybind changing :D, one of my favourite QoL features in games)<br>
              <br>
      	    Removed:<br>
        	    Nothing<br>
        	    <br>
      	    Fixed:<br>
          	  The font class I used to render text couldn't be disposed of and stayed in memory no matter what so before it was fixed, you would only have to leave the game running for a COUPLE MINUTES for it to use AN ENTIRE GIGABYTE OF RAM, so that was crazy but i fixed it by not instantiating a new class every frame but reusing them for the same sized font<br>
          	  <br>
        	  To do:<br>
          	  Actually show which slots in the inventory are for what,<br>
          	  Add more items,<br>
          	  Actually make it a roguelike by adding further dungeons and completely reseting when you die,<br>
              Figure out how to make sprites in under an hour (the fire crystal sprite literally took me a couple hours just because I kept looking for the right colur/shape but couldn't get it right and I just ended up going back to a previous design in the end)<br>
        	    <br>
        	  Known Bugs:<br>
              be careful when messing around with debug features<br>
              (eg. weapon swapping while moving around the weapon)<br>
              <br>
            Controls:<br>
              <strong>W|A|S|D</strong> : movement<br>
              <strong>left click</strong> : attack with your current weapon<br>
              <strong>Z|X|C|V|B</strong> : use item 1|2|3|4|5<br>
              <strong>Tab</strong> : open/close inventory<br>
              <strong>Esc</strong> : open menu / cancel keybind change<br>
              <strong>[DEBUG]</strong>:<br>
              <strong>Space</strong> : summon insta kill weapon at mouse cursor<br>
              <strong>-|=</strong> : zooming(not supposed to be necessary so will probably be removed)<br>
              <strong>1</strong> : show/hide fps<br>
              <strong>2</strong> : show/hide hitboxes<br>
              <strong>3</strong> : toggle the enemies' AI<br>
              <strong>4</strong> : toggle noclip mode<br>
              <strong>5</strong> : toggle smooth animation for the inventory<br>
              <strong>`</strong>(top-left of keyboard) : swap weapons (only way to get the long sword)<br>
              <strong>0</strong> : toggle maximum FPS (100 <-> 1000)<br>
              <strong>,|.</strong> : move the lowest (non-item) object left|right (not really very useful anymore)

              <br>
      	    <strong>Changed:</strong><br>
        	    The default maximum FPS from 100 to 60 for a smoother experience<br>(better to have a low stable fps than a higher but jerky and stuttery one),<br>
              The position of the armour display outside of the inventory,<br>
              The cooldown of the items to better work with the stamina/mana system<br>
        	    <br>

        	    Nothing<br>
        	    <br>
      	    <strong>Fixed:</strong><br>
          	  The item dropping could sometimes put items in the wall in tight spaces<br>like corridors, that shouldn't happen any more<br>

              <strong>7</strong> : toggle smooth delta (smoothens the fps, only really affects higher max fps due to instability)<br>
